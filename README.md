In recent years, there has been a rise in the adoption of electronic payment methods in an increasing number of locations all over the world. However, putting this technology to use in rural areas and countries of the third world remains challenging, mostly because to the unreliable internet connection that exists in those locales. Electronic payments create a variety of issues in rural areas because of the limitations of the technology and the limited internet connectivity. In this article, we present a proposal for a system that is based on Blockchain technology and is able to provide a secure electronic payment service even in the event that a user does not have access to a reliable internet connection. This capability is essential in order for the system to be viable. The technology of distributed ledgers, sometimes known as blockchain, along with digital signatures, Bluetooth, and smart contracts are the core technologies underpinning the system that is being proposed. After putting together a proposal for the system, we construct it in the form of a mobile application that includes a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain
